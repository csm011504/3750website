            </header>
            <p>Clemson believes in the value of hard work, and the pursuit to work tirelessly. They believe that their collective calling as a University is to change lives, 
              change perception and, through their work, to change the world.</p>
            <p>I'd say they're pretty good at this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I mean here I am making a website, I think that's pretty cool.</li>
                <li>I'm also in a club where I got to ride in a Porsche around a racetrack.</li>
                <li>The campus is also absolutly gorgeous, did you see that snow?</li>
            </ul>
