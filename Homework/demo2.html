                <h2>I really like racecars(All these headers are using the box model I think):</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The first thing that drew me into motorsport was probablt my introduction to Formula One. I liked cars before hand thanks to The Fast and the Furious and Cars, but I didn't know about the pro stuff.</p>
            <p>Since that point I've been to 3-ish major events:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I went to Barber Motorsports Park with the Clemson Tiger Racing Team, life changing(Here is a list)</li>
                <li>I've been to the Petit Le Man endurance race in Georgia three times</li>
                <li>I've been to a Trans Am weekend in Georgia twice(I'll lump Nascar in here too cause I wouldn't consider it major).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <aside>
            <h3>The Future(I used floats on the other assignment a lot, I don't really feel like doing it on this page):</h3>
            <p>I plan to get at least started on a racing license through Clemson Tiger Racing that will allow me to take a car to the track,
              once I have one worthy of that. As I mentioned in my personal page, my dream car is a 1968 Mustang. </p>

            </header>
            <p>I have far to many plans for the car to fit on a website meant for homework. I could post some pictures though.</p>
